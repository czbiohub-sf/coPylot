    Save a model's dictionary representation to a YAML file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : object
        The model object to convert to YAML.
    yaml_path : Path
        The path to the output YAML file.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the `model` object does not have a `dict()` method.

    Notes
    -----
    This function converts a model object into a dictionary representation
    using the `dict()` method. It removes any fields with None values before
    writing the dictionary to a YAML file.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from my_model import MyModel
    >>> model = MyModel()
    >>> model_to_yaml(model, 'model.yaml')

def yaml_to_model(yaml_path: Path, model):
    """
    Load model settings from a YAML file and create a model instance.

    Borrowing from recOrder==0.4.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    yaml_path : Path
        The path to the YAML file containing the model settings.
    model : class
        The model class used to create an instance with the loaded settings.

    Returns
    -------
    object
        An instance of the model class with the loaded settings.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the provided model is not a class or does not have a callable constructor.
    FileNotFoundError
        If the YAML file specified by `yaml_path` does not exist.

    Notes
    -----
    This function loads model settings from a YAML file using `yaml.safe_load()`.
    It then creates an instance of the provided `model` class using the loaded settings.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from my_model import MyModel
    >>> model = yaml_to_model('model.yaml', MyModel)
