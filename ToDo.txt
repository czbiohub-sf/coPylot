- make range boxes visually different to value input box
- try making boxes only appear on right click
- reformat to remove need for scroll bar
- stop min range box from being set higher than max range //

21.01.21 Change log
- spinboxes replaced with QLineEdit boxes.
- string input and min_range > max_range edge cases addressed
- addition of button to trigger range input (double click slider still works)
- addition of column labels. Could not synchronize them with contents, so size of parameter input widget was fixed

- refactor left window into separate class?
- make DoubleClickableSlider reusable?
- improve file naming
-

Notes:
difference in range step size is due to adaptive step size in setStepType assignment
